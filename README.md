The dataset is used for this competition is synthetic, but based on a real dataset and generated using a CTGAN. The original dataset deals with predicting the category on an eCommerce product given various attributes about the listing. Although the features are anonymized, they have properties relating to real-world features.

## Evaluation Metric

For this competition, the metric is imposed: the __multi-class logarithmic loss__

## Notes

The Repository contains several branches that are associated with various models/investigations I tested. The model with the best performances has been merged to the master branch.
